              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>
                Hi, I’m Blake! For the past 6 years, I’ve been deep in the world of matchmaking — helping incredible people find real, meaningful connection. I’ve matched countless couples by getting to know what truly matters to them in love and in life, and by creating a space where they can show up as their best, most authentic selves.
              </p>
              <p>
                But I don’t just set people up — I coach them through the emotional rollercoaster that dating can be. From the butterflies to the “what just happened?” moments, I’m there to guide, cheer, and refocus. My goal? To help you stay grounded, hopeful, and genuinely excited about the process of finding your person.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're ready to stop overthinking and start dating with clarity, confidence, and heart — I'm here to help!
              </p>
